    <h1> :Hades: </h1>
    <p>Hades, the Greek god of the underworld, is a complex and fascinating figure in mythology. Here's a more detailed look at his role and attributes:</p><br>

    <h2>Ruler of the Underworld:</h2>

    <p>As the god of the underworld, Hades presided over the realm of the dead, also known as Hades.
        He was responsible for judging the souls of the deceased and assigning them to their appropriate place in the afterlife, whether it be the Elysian fields for the virtuous or the Tartarus for the wicked.
    </p><br>
    <h2>God of Wealth:</h2>
    <p>Hades was also associated with wealth and riches, particularly those found underground, such as metals and precious stones.
        This connection to wealth is perhaps surprising given his association with death, but it may reflect the idea that the riches of the earth come from beneath the surface.
    </p><br>
    <h2> Symbolism:</h2>
    <p><span>Cerberus:</span>Hades was often symbolized by his three-headed dog, Cerberus, who guarded the gates of the Underworld. Cerberus was feared for his fierce nature and his ability to prevent the dead from escaping.<br>
<span>Cypress Tree:</span> The cypress tree was sacred to Hades and was often associated with mourning and death.</p> <br>
    <h2>Personality and Portrayal:</h2>

<p>Hades was often depicted as a stern and imposing figure, reflecting his role as the ruler of the underworld.
However, he was also known for his fairness and impartiality in his judgments of the dead.
In some myths, Hades is portrayed as a more sympathetic figure, struggling with the challenges of his domain and the weight of his responsibilities.
</p><br>
<h2>Relationship with Other Gods:</h2>

<p>Hades was one of the three major Olympian deities, along with Zeus and Poseidon.
His relationship with his brothers was often strained, particularly with Zeus, who was known for his ambitious and domineering nature.<br>
Overall, Hades was a complex and multifaceted figure in Greek mythology, embodying both the fear and respect associated with death and the underworld.
